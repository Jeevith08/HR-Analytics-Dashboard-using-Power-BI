HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI
📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to analyze and visualize employee-related data. The dashboard helps organizations gain actionable insights into workforce trends such as headcount, attrition, gender diversity, age distribution, department-wise strength, and geographical distribution.

The goal of this project is to transform raw HR data into meaningful visual insights that support data-driven HR decision-making.
